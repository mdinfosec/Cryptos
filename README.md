# Cryptos
A messily modified one-time-pad cipher that utilises steganography to conceal the key file within a PNG image.
It is based on Al Sweigart's python implementation of a Vigen√®re Cipher, with the addition of basic file handling and key concealment using steganography.
Requires an installation of python Image library and Stepic.

Based upon the work of Al Sweigart and his book Hacking Secret Ciphers With Python which inspired me to try coding: http://inventwithpython.com/hacking/index.html
